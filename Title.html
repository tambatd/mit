            You will see a prompt below asking you to design an app. Using the
            interface below, create a schema that represents a complete set of
            tables you would need in order to create the app. For each table,
            enter a set of fields for that table along with their types (int,
            string). Types may be tables that you've created (student, teacher,
            assignment).

            <h2>
              Example Prompt: I want a classroom management app that tracks
              students, the assignments they've submitted, and the grades
              they've earned on those assignments.
            </h2>
            <p>
              Schema: This schema shows 4 tables: a student table, a submission
              table, an assignment table, and a teacher table.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Notice that in the student table, the types of "teacher",
                "assignments", and "submissions" all reference other objects
                (tables).
              </li>
              <li>
                In addition, notice that since a student may have multiple
                assignments, the type of "assignments" is a list.
              </li>
            </ul>
